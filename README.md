# Wayfarer

## Introductions

> Given a wireframe and user stories, I created a react-express travel app that allows users to check out different cities as well as submit posts to each city. Under each city page, users can see the collection of posts for each city.

## Built With

* React
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## Existing Features

* User account creation/storage
* User authentication on signup
* React carousel
* Individual city pages for 5 cities
* Scrollable post feed for each city, ordered from newest to oldest
* Users can create posts for each city, as well as update or delete any posts they have created
* Users can click on a post to view its details


## Installation and Deployment

> To run this app on your local system, fork or clone the repository [here](https://github.com/gabe-ng/wayfarer). On your local system, navigate to the project directory within your terminal and run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then, in 3 separate terminal windows, start up MongoDB using `mongod`, start your server using `nodemon server.js`, and lastly start up your react project using `yarn start` or `npm start`.
